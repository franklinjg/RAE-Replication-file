# This is  for my Research in Applied Economics project for the University of Warwick. 

Much discussion is had about how economic policy impacts the lives of people around the world. Aditionally, much of the discussion is concerned on how to design good policy, with good policy and proper data analysis they say we can mitigate the "downsides" of having a mixed market. Unfortunately, even if we had the solutions to our problems they would not be considered by politicians and legislators as they are imbedded in a Network where the incentives are misplaced. What good is a legislator if he only cares about his political party and himself? Legislators also do not have complete information and unlimited time to read about which policies are good and bad for the population they represent.

Welcome to my READMEFILE. 

Version of Python I used: 3.12.1

My computer has 8GB of RAM but this code should run in any computer if left for a long enough time.
